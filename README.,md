Notes

- my code is served out of public folder -- express references that.
- bower_components have been moved there and are referenced relative to that public folder
- all other path references, such as app where my code is, is relative to public as well
- not sure if I need this command to view the deployed app on heroku:
-- heroku ps:scale web=1
- codeship -- hooks up to the repository and runs a build every check in
- Karma -- for front end testing
- PhantomJS -- replaces a browser.  This is for situations when working on a remote machine
(such as Cloud9 environment) and the browser is not available. PhantomJS also emulates multiple
browsers
