Notes

- my code is served out of public folder -- express references that.
- bower_components and have been moved there and are referenced relative to that public folder
- all other path references, such as app where my code is, is relative to public as well
- not sure if I need this command to view the deployed app on heroku:
-- heroku ps:scale web=1
